# Multicore-Processor
Dual Core Processor design

Computer Prototyping Lab (ECE 437, Purdue University)
Dual Core, pipedlined processor design with Cache Coherency using MIPS architecture
Implemented with a memory controller using the MSI protocol
Tested with parallel algorithms in assembly
Builds off of previous pipeline and single cycle processor designs
